                    The Hypertext Mark-up Language (or HTML) is the language used to create documents for the World Wide Web. As the name implies it is a mark-up language - the original (ASCII) text is edited and new (text) codes are added to indicate how (and where) the text should appear.

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    When an HTML document is read by a suitable Web browser specifically designed to understand HTML codes, such as Internet Explorer or Firefox, the formatting codes are interpreted and the text is displayed in an attractive and more dynamic way. HTML documents can include graphics, and, more importantly, links to other documents - hypertext.

                    <br>

                    An HTML document can be produced in free-format, i.e. it doesn't matter what the text file looks like it is the browser that does the formatting. HTML is not so much concerned about the appearance of the documents but about the structure of a document.

                    HTML documents contain codes that mark headings, paragraphs, lists (3-types), tables etc. Many other formatting codes and tags are available for usage.

                    CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts. It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens, small screens, or printers. CSS is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language. The separation of HTML from CSS makes it easier to maintain sites, share style sheets across pages, and tailor pages to different environments. This is referred to as the separation of structure (or: content) from presentation.

                    JavaScript is a very powerful client-side scripting language. JavaScript is used mainly for enhancing the interaction of a user with the webpage. In other words, you can make your webpage more lively and interactive, with the help of JavaScript. JavaScript is also being used widely in game development and mobile application development. JavaScript is an interpreted language. Thus, it doesn't need to be compiled. JavaScript renders web pages in an interactive and dynamic fashion. This allowing the pages to react to events, exhibit special effects, accept variable text,
                    validate data, create cookies, detect a userâ€™s browser, etc.
